            <p>Korean beauty has always been a bit of mystery for all of us. We all long for that hourglass clear skin and glossy glow.</p>
            <p>There are various products that claim to treat and make your skin flawless just like those Glowing Korean Women. But here’s the thing, Koreans are naturally blessed with beautiful and clear skin from their ancestors. Koreans have always been known for their beauty. But can you achieve such a glow on your skin? The answer is Yes!</p>
            <p>Body image is the perception that a person has of their physical self and the thoughts and feelings that result from that perception.</p>
            <p>According to the definition, these feelings can be positive (that the person feels extremely confident under his/her own skin) negative (that the person doesn't feel confident under his/ her own skin) or both, and are influenced by individual and environmental factors. But in accordance to research studies, chances are that the latter part is more predominant i.e That feeling that you don't look like a supermodel, that you do not confer to the conventional beauty standards of having a zero to negative figure, beautiful hair and flawless skin, proper height and booty etc. This leads to the changing eating patterns. Because after all! Where will all those carbs go?</p>
            <P>The MINDS Foundation recognises that both social stigma and economic burden keeps many of the Indians from seeking help for mental health issues. India, a refuge for billions but refuge only physically and I don't think so the same goes for mental health as well! Is the same even taken into consideration?</P>
            <P>Well! I could vouch on the fact that half of the population (and some of the readers of this blog as well) don't even know what mental health is all about! A place where people visit temples and address cynical religious Guru Ji's when any sign of abnormal behaviour is displayed.</P>
            <P>According, to an NGO which works in the sector of mental wellness, 86% of the suicides occur in the low and middle class in developing countries like India. This even defies the well-known idiom that riches cause sleepless nights. Thus, the entire burden falls on the energy that we derive from, i.e. our food! The result is disturbed eating patterns.</P>
            <p>Binge watching some YouTube diet videos, listening to the advice of some diet consultant and deciding upon a diet which doesn't even take your body type or blood group into account, ends up with people falling prey into one of the following eating disorders:</p>
            <p>Eating Disorders describe illnesses that are characterized by irregular eating habits and severe distress or concern about body weight or shape.</p>
            <p>Eating disturbances may include inadequate or excessive food intake which can ultimately damage an individual's well-being. The most common forms of eating disorders include Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, and Binge Eating Disorder and affect both females and males.</p>

            <p>This eating disorder is characterized by repeated binge eating followed by behaviours that compensate for the overeating, such as forced vomiting, excessive exercise, or extreme use of laxatives or diuretics. Men and women who suffer from Bulimia may fear weight gain and feel severely unhappy with their body size and shape. The binge-eating and purging cycle is typically done in secret, creating feelings of shame, guilt, and lack of control. Bulimia can have injuring effects, such as gastrointestinal problems, severe dehydration, and heart difficulties resulting from an electrolyte imbalance. Combating this mental condition requires mental strength and above all will power. Still some medicines can provide you with a tranquil sensation so as to aid the process of recovery. Ayurvedic medicines can go a long way in the healing process of the mind like Dr. Reckeweg's sedative drops. You can buy the medicine here by directly clicking on the link.</p>

            <p>Although there are a lot more different classes and categories of eating disorders which have cropped up recently due to the increasing social stigma and peer pressure, yet to summarize these were the common few types.</p>
            <p>If you land upon identifying with one of these eating disorders or struggle everyday with your body image, I would like to say that always remember that you are not alone. Nobody is perfect and there are millions out there who feel the same. Always seek medical help if the burden feels cumbersome. Coming out is pretty difficult but then help is always available. If my blog impacts even a single person, I would deem myself as successful.</p>
            <p>In the end I would like to end by quoting a few lines from Maya Angelou:</p>
            <strong>"Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.

            </strong><br><br>
            <strong>I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size</strong><br><br>
            <strong>But when I start to tell them,</strong><br><br>
            <strong>They think I'm telling lies..."</strong><br><br>
            <p>Folks, this is the confidence one should inculcate within oneself. Maya Angelou is as an inspiration for many and continues to be my idol.</p>

      <h2>About Healthmug</h2>
      <p>With a vision of bridging the gap between a pharmacy and the consumers, Healthmug came into its existence
        in
        2016. A
        vision that quickly broadened up and helped it in becoming more than just a mere online portal, to an online
        marketplace
        for shopping Ayurvedic to Homeopathy to Unani medicines to Health Supplements and much more. Since its
        inception,
        Healthmug has grown into a world-class e-platform for everything related to health & fitness. What draws a
        major
        distinction between us and our contemporaries is the way we promote a harmonious relationship between the
        sellers and
        the buyers for the greater good.</p>
      <p>Healthmug is the brainchild of Dr. Mohit Agarwal & Mr. Anubhav Bansal. They started this online platform
        with
        an idea of

        medicines and
        to improve the health of the consumers in a holistic way. With an ever-expanding range of products and
        services,

        easy
        and
        hassle-free. Since day one, we have supported many small & medium local brands to sell their products and
        have
        helped
        them in sharpening their entrepreneurial skills. Along with these, we have also given numerous big brands a
        platform to
        expand their customer base. We believe in the philosophy of growing together and thus we motivate the
        sellers
        to do
        their best. All thanks to our comprehendible policies, everyone from a small seller to a wholesaler to a
