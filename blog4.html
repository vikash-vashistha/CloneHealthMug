            <p>Herbal teas used to sound very dull, serious and boring to me, like something old people would drink as medicine. Then I figured that they're nothing but normal black or green tea infused with some herbs, now that sounded quite interesting. Being a self- proclaimed tea fanatic, how could I not try them out? So obviously I did and made a list of herbal teas with multiple health benefits that are without a doubt great for your health.</p>

            <h2>Tulsi Tea</h2>
            <img 
            src="https://static.oxinis.com/healthmug/image/blog/article/4-1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Tulsi or basil is considered to be the most important herb, often called as 'the queen of herbs'. It is rightly named so because it is tremendously good for your health. It has been used as a medicinal herb by Indians for centuries. Modern research also came to the conclusion that tulsi has many constituents, including those with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
            <p>Stress has found a permanent place in our minds lately. From a mere school going kid to a retired elderly person, all of our lives are filled with the stress of one sort or another be it worry, anxiety or tension. Our minds are never at peace. This should not be taken lightly, prolonged stress can cause severe effects on our mental and physical health. It can hamper your immune system's functions, impairing your digestive system and affect your memory and mood. Tulsi tea can help reduce some of the effects of stress by enhancing stamina and promoting immune function.</p>
            <p>Basil can be beneficial in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. High blood sugar is caused when your body is unable to breakdown sugar (or glucose) properly. In a research done by University of Michigan Health System it was found that Basil leaves can help control the blood sugar levels of people with type 2 diabetes. Even if you don't have diabetes, you can still drink basil tea to prevent yourself from this monstrous disease. Prevention is always better than cure.</p>
            <p>Basil has been used traditionally to treat various respiratory problems such as bronchitis, cough and cold. Other diseases commonly treated with basil tea include inflammation, fever, heart disease, poisoning, stomach complaints and malaria</p>
            <h2>Ginger Tea</h2>
           
            <img src="https://static.oxinis.com/healthmug/image/blog/article/4-2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>We all crush a little bit of ginger while making tea in winters. Fusing ginger with tea not only gives it a great taste and sooth our throats it also adds a very healthy twist to your tea. If you're feeling ill, a cup of ginger tea can instantly make you feel a little better.</p>
            <p>Ginger tea has a soothing and relaxing effect on problems related to stomach, it can effectively and quickly relieve gassiness, indigestion, and constipation. Another beneficial effect of this herbal tea is that it helps in settling overactive stomach acids.</p>
            <p>Ginger helps in improving, supporting and strengthening your vocal chords. So if you've got an important lecture or presentation to give, drinking ginger tea can prove to be great for your voice. Research studies done in University of Maryland Medical Center suggest that ginger helps relieve nausea induced by chemotherapy or surgery as well as motion sickness and morning sickness.</p>
            <p>Ginger tea's anti-inflammatory qualities can help your body alleviate pains and aches, it can be helpful for back pains, headaches and menstrual cramps. It also helps in reducing muscle pain. Ginger naturally possesses an anti-inflammatory called 'gingerol' which is helpful in reducing muscle soreness which is common after exercise and sports</p>
            <p>This herbal tea is a good source of antioxidants that can boost metabolism and encourage your body to burn fat more effectively. One of the numerous advantages of antioxidants is that they work to reverse the premature signs of aging such as dull and dry skin, fine lines, wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity and cherry on the top - extra hydration you receive from sipping ginger tea nourishes your skin!</p>
            <p>Ginger tea is a good source of essential minerals and vitamins such as calcium, potassium, zinc, magnesium, and vitamins B6, C, and D. it also carries anti-parasitic, antibacterial and antiviral benefits.</p>
            <h2>Cinnamon Tea</h2>
            <img src="https://static.oxinis.com/healthmug/image/blog/article/4-3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>This eating disorder is characterized by repeated binge eating followed by behaviours that compensate for the overeating, such as forced vomiting, excessive exercise, or extreme use of laxatives or diuretics. Men and women who suffer from Bulimia may fear weight gain and feel severely unhappy with their body size and shape. The binge-eating and purging cycle is typically done in secret, creating feelings of shame, guilt, and lack of control. Bulimia can have injuring effects, such as gastrointestinal problems, severe dehydration, and heart difficulties resulting from an electrolyte imbalance. Combating this mental condition requires mental strength and above all will power. Still some medicines can provide you with a tranquil sensation so as to aid the process of recovery. Ayurvedic medicines can go a long way in the healing process of the mind like Dr. Reckeweg's sedative drops. You can buy the medicine here by directly clicking on the link.</p>

            <p>Although there are a lot more different classes and categories of eating disorders which have cropped up recently due to the increasing social stigma and peer pressure, yet to summarize these were the common few types.</p>
            <p>If you land upon identifying with one of these eating disorders or struggle everyday with your body image, I would like to say that always remember that you are not alone. Nobody is perfect and there are millions out there who feel the same. Always seek medical help if the burden feels cumbersome. Coming out is pretty difficult but then help is always available. If my blog impacts even a single person, I would deem myself as successful.</p>
            <p>In the end I would like to end by quoting a few lines from Maya Angelou:</p>
            <strong>"Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.

            </strong><br><br>
            <strong>I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size</strong><br><br>
            <strong>But when I start to tell them,</strong><br><br>
            <strong>They think I'm telling lies..."</strong><br><br>
            <p>Folks, this is the confidence one should inculcate within oneself. Maya Angelou is as an inspiration for many and continues to be my idol.</p>

      <h2>About Healthmug</h2>
      <p>With a vision of bridging the gap between a pharmacy and the consumers, Healthmug came into its existence
        in
        2016. A
        vision that quickly broadened up and helped it in becoming more than just a mere online portal, to an online
        marketplace
        for shopping Ayurvedic to Homeopathy to Unani medicines to Health Supplements and much more. Since its
        inception,
        Healthmug has grown into a world-class e-platform for everything related to health & fitness. What draws a
        major
        distinction between us and our contemporaries is the way we promote a harmonious relationship between the
        sellers and
        the buyers for the greater good.</p>
      <p>Healthmug is the brainchild of Dr. Mohit Agarwal & Mr. Anubhav Bansal. They started this online platform
        with

        medicines and

        easy
        and
        hassle-free. Since day one, we have supported many small & medium local brands to sell their products and
        have
        helped
        them in sharpening their entrepreneurial skills. Along with these, we have also given numerous big brands a
        platform to
        expand their customer base. We believe in the philosophy of growing together and thus we motivate the
        sellers
        to do
        their best. All thanks to our comprehendible policies, everyone from a small seller to a wholesaler to a
